			<p> <b>New-York</b> based <strong>short-seller</strong> Hindenburg Research published its report on the Adani Group of companies on January 24<sup>th</sup> accusing the group of engaging in stock manipulation and accounting fraud over the course of decades. The Adani Group responded to the group and said the report is "a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations". Shares of Adani Enterprises, the flagship company of the ports-to-energy conglomerate, were due to go on sale on  January 25 in India's largest-ever secondary share offering. Despite the report, the company went ahead with the FPO launch. The Follow-On Public Offering (FPO) sailed through the initial hiccups and was fully subscribed on January 31. But within a day, the company <i>declared</i> it had <em>cancelled</em> its FPO and would return its investors' money. 
From January 24<sup>th</sup> to February 3, <mark>Adani Group companies</mark> lost around Rs 9 lakh crore m-cap in seven trading sessions. The total market capitalisation of the Adani Group slipped to Rs 10 lakh crore on February 3 from Rs 19.2<sub>lakh</sub> crore as of January 24, the day Hindenburg Research made its report public.
